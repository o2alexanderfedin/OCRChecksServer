# Test Fixtures

This directory contains files used for testing the OCR Checks Server.

## Directory Structure

```
fixtures/
├── expected/      # Expected test outputs for validation
└── images/        # Sample check images for testing
```

## Images

The `images/` directory contains sample check images used by tests:

- `IMG_2388.jpg` - Sample check image for OCR testing
- `IMG_2388.HEIC` - HEIC format version of the same image (for testing format conversion)
- `telegram-cloud-photo-size-1-4915775046379745521-y.jpg` - Additional check sample
- `telegram-cloud-photo-size-1-4915775046379745522-y.jpg` - Additional check sample

## Expected Results

The `expected/` directory contains reference data generated by tests:

- `mistral-ocr-results.json` - OCR results generated by the Mistral API for validation

## Usage

These fixtures are primarily used by:

1. Semi-integration tests (`tests/semi/`) which process real images
2. Integration tests (`tests/integration/`) which test the full application

When adding new test cases, consider adding appropriate fixtures to this directory.
