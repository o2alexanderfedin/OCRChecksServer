   - Click "Change" next to your current plan to see available upgrades

2. **Select an Appropriate Plan**:
   - Workers Paid: For production workloads with higher request limits and CPU time
   - Workers Unbound: For more demanding applications with flexible usage-based pricing

3. **Complete Upgrade Process**:
   - Follow the prompts to add payment information
   - Review the terms and pricing
   - Confirm your plan selection

### Setting Up Access Policies (For Team Projects)

If you're working in a team environment, you might want to set up access policies:

1. **Create Access Groups**:
   - Go to the Cloudflare dashboard
   - Navigate to "Access" and then "Groups"
   - Create groups for different roles (e.g., "Developers", "Administrators")

2. **Configure Access Policies**:
   - Create policies that define who can deploy to different environments
   - For example, only allow specific developers to deploy to production

3. **Set Up Service Tokens**:
   - For CI/CD systems, create service tokens with appropriate permissions
   - Store these tokens securely in your CI/CD environment

## Setting Up Your Local Environment

Follow these steps to set up your local environment for deployment:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to your preferred directory for projects
3. Clone the repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/OCRChecksServer.git
cd OCRChecksServer
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install all required npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Install Wrangler CLI

Wrangler is Cloudflare's command-line tool for managing Workers. Install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

### Step 4: Authenticate with Cloudflare

Log in to your Cloudflare account through Wrangler:

```bash
wrangler login
```

![Wrangler Login Command](./images/deployment/wrangler-login-command.png)

This will open a browser window asking you to authorize Wrangler to access your Cloudflare account. 

![Cloudflare Login Screen](./images/deployment/cloudflare-login.png)

Follow the prompts to complete the authorization.

### Step 5: Verify Configuration

Ensure the `wrangler.toml` file is properly configured. This file contains the deployment settings for each environment. Review the file to make sure all settings are correct, especially:

- Worker name
- Routes (if applicable)
- Environment variables

If you need to make changes, update the file according to your specific requirements.

## Understanding Environments

The OCR Checks Server supports three deployment environments, each with its own configuration:

### 1. Development Environment
- **Purpose**: Used for ongoing development and testing new features
- **URL**: dev-api.nolock.social or {your-subdomain}.workers.dev
- **Wrangler Environment**: `dev` (default)
- **Configuration**: Less restrictive, may use test API keys
- **When to use**: For daily development work and testing features before staging
- **Note**: This is the default environment for all deployment and monitoring tools

### 2. Staging Environment
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing and validation
- **URL**: staging-api.nolock.social
- **Wrangler Environment**: `staging`
- **Configuration**: Mirrors production settings but uses non-production data
- **When to use**: For final testing before moving to production

### 3. Production Environment
- **Purpose**: Live, user-facing service
- **URL**: api.nolock.social
- **Wrangler Environment**: `production`
- **Configuration**: Optimized for performance and security
- **When to use**: Only for validated, tested code ready for end users

Each environment has its own section in the `wrangler.toml` file, with specific settings tailored to that environment's requirements.

## Manual Deployment Process

This section covers manual deployment using the Wrangler CLI. Follow these steps for each environment:

### Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables

The recommended approach is to create a `.dev.vars` file in the project root with your environment variables:

```
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

This file will be automatically used by Wrangler for local development and by our deployment scripts to set up secrets in Cloudflare.

Alternatively, you can set the environment variables manually:

```bash
# For Linux/macOS
export MISTRAL_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# For Windows Command Prompt
set MISTRAL_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# For Windows PowerShell
$env:MISTRAL_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual Mistral API key.

### Step 2: Choose Your Target Environment

Decide which environment you want to deploy to: development, staging, or production. The deployment command will differ based on your choice.

### Step 3: Deploy Using Wrangler

Run the appropriate deployment command:

```bash
# For development environment (default)
wrangler deploy 
# or explicitly specify dev environment
wrangler deploy --env dev

# For staging environment
wrangler deploy --env staging

# For production environment
wrangler deploy --env production
```

Alternatively, you can use npm scripts:

```bash
# For development environment (default)
npm run deploy
# or explicitly specify dev environment  
npm run deploy -- --env dev

# For staging environment
npm run deploy -- --env staging

# For production environment
npm run deploy -- --env production
```

You can also use our convenience script which handles setting up secrets:

```bash
# For development environment (default)
bash scripts/deploy-with-secrets.sh

# For staging environment
bash scripts/deploy-with-secrets.sh staging

# For production environment
bash scripts/deploy-with-secrets.sh production
```

### Step 4: Wait for Deployment Completion

The deployment process may take a few minutes. Wrangler will show a progress indicator and display a confirmation message when the deployment is complete. The output should look similar to:

```
Deploying to env "dev"...
Successfully deployed to https://dev-api.nolock.social
```

![Wrangler Deployment Command](./images/deployment/wrangler-deployment-command.png)

### Step 5: Verify the Deployment

After the deployment completes, verify that the service is working correctly:

1. Visit the health endpoint:
   - Development: https://dev-api.nolock.social/health
   - Staging: https://staging-api.nolock.social/health
   - Production: https://api.nolock.social/health

2. Check the version number in the response to confirm the deployed version
