## Introduction

This guide provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for deploying the OCR Checks Server to Cloudflare Workers. It is designed for users of all experience levels, including those who are new to Cloudflare Workers or deployment processes in general.

The OCR Checks Server is deployed as a Cloudflare Worker that processes images using Mistral AI for optical character recognition (OCR). This guide covers both manual deployment for individual developers and automated deployment using GitHub Actions for team environments.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the deployment process, ensure you have:

1. **Cloudflare Account**:
   - A Cloudflare account with Workers enabled
   - Access to the Cloudflare dashboard
   - Properly configured domain (if using custom domains)

2. **API Credentials**:
   - Cloudflare API token with Workers deployment permissions
   - Mistral AI API key for OCR processing

3. **Development Tools**:
   - Node.js (version 16 or higher) installed on your computer
   - npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer
   - Git installed on your computer
   - A code editor (Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc.)

4. **Project Access**:
   - Access to the OCR Checks Server repository
   - Proper permissions to deploy to Cloudflare
   - For GitHub Actions: Admin access to the repository settings

## Setting Up Your Local Environment

Follow these steps to set up your local environment for deployment:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to your preferred directory for projects
3. Clone the repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/OCRChecksServer.git
cd OCRChecksServer
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install all required npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Install Wrangler CLI

Wrangler is Cloudflare's command-line tool for managing Workers. Install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

### Step 4: Authenticate with Cloudflare

Log in to your Cloudflare account through Wrangler:

```bash
wrangler login
```

![Wrangler Login Command](./images/deployment/wrangler-login-command.png)

This will open a browser window asking you to authorize Wrangler to access your Cloudflare account. 

![Cloudflare Login Screen](./images/deployment/cloudflare-login.png)

Follow the prompts to complete the authorization.

### Step 5: Verify Configuration

Ensure the `wrangler.toml` file is properly configured. This file contains the deployment settings for each environment. Review the file to make sure all settings are correct, especially:

- Worker name
- Routes (if applicable)
- Environment variables

If you need to make changes, update the file according to your specific requirements.

## Understanding Environments

The OCR Checks Server supports three deployment environments, each with its own configuration:

### 1. Development Environment
- **Purpose**: Used for ongoing development and testing new features
- **URL**: dev-api.nolock.social
- **Wrangler Environment**: `dev`
- **Configuration**: Less restrictive, may use test API keys
- **When to use**: For daily development work and testing features before staging

### 2. Staging Environment
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing and validation
- **URL**: staging-api.nolock.social
- **Wrangler Environment**: `staging`
- **Configuration**: Mirrors production settings but uses non-production data
- **When to use**: For final testing before moving to production

### 3. Production Environment
- **Purpose**: Live, user-facing service
- **URL**: api.nolock.social
- **Wrangler Environment**: `production`
- **Configuration**: Optimized for performance and security
- **When to use**: Only for validated, tested code ready for end users

Each environment has its own section in the `wrangler.toml` file, with specific settings tailored to that environment's requirements.

## Manual Deployment Process

This section covers manual deployment using the Wrangler CLI. Follow these steps for each environment:

### Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables

Before deploying, you need to set the required environment variables. The most important is the Mistral API key:

```bash
# For Linux/macOS
export MISTRAL_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# For Windows Command Prompt
set MISTRAL_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# For Windows PowerShell
$env:MISTRAL_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual Mistral API key.

### Step 2: Choose Your Target Environment

Decide which environment you want to deploy to: development, staging, or production. The deployment command will differ based on your choice.

### Step 3: Deploy Using Wrangler

Run the appropriate deployment command:

```bash
# For development environment
wrangler deploy --env dev

# For staging environment
wrangler deploy --env staging

# For production environment
wrangler deploy --env production
```

Alternatively, you can use npm scripts:

```bash
# For development environment
npm run deploy -- --env dev

# For staging environment
npm run deploy -- --env staging

# For production environment
npm run deploy -- --env production
```

### Step 4: Wait for Deployment Completion

The deployment process may take a few minutes. Wrangler will show a progress indicator and display a confirmation message when the deployment is complete. The output should look similar to:

```
Deploying to env "dev"...
Successfully deployed to https://dev-api.nolock.social
```

### Step 5: Verify the Deployment

After the deployment completes, verify that the service is working correctly:

1. Visit the health endpoint:
   - Development: https://dev-api.nolock.social/health
   - Staging: https://staging-api.nolock.social/health
   - Production: https://api.nolock.social/health

2. Check the version number in the response to confirm the deployed version

## Automated Deployment with GitHub Actions

The OCR Checks Server project uses GitHub Actions for automated deployment, following the GitFlow workflow. Here's how it works:

### Understanding the Automated Workflow

The deployment is automatically triggered based on the branch:

1. **Develop Branch**: Any push to the `develop` branch deploys to the development environment
2. **Release Branches**: Any push to a branch starting with `release/` deploys to the staging environment
3. **Main Branch**: Any push to the `main` branch deploys to the production environment

### Viewing Deployment Status

To view the status of automated deployments:

1. Go to the GitHub repository
2. Click on the "Actions" tab
3. Find the relevant workflow run
4. Check the deployment progress and status

![GitHub Actions Workflow](./images/deployment/github-actions-workflow.png)

### Manual Triggering of Workflows

You can also manually trigger deployments:

1. Go to the GitHub repository
2. Click on the "Actions" tab
3. Select the appropriate workflow (e.g., "Deploy to Production")
4. Click "Run workflow"
5. Select the branch and confirm

## Environment Variables and Secrets

Proper management of environment variables and secrets is crucial for secure deployments.

### Required Environment Variables

The OCR Checks Server requires the following environment variables:

1. **MISTRAL_API_KEY**: API key for Mistral AI services

### Setting Up Secrets in GitHub

For automated deployments using GitHub Actions, set up secrets:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings"
3. Select "Secrets and variables" from the left sidebar
4. Click on "Actions"
5. Click "New repository secret"
6. Add each required secret:
   - Name: `MISTRAL_API_KEY`
   - Value: Your Mistral API key
   - Name: `CF_API_TOKEN`
   - Value: Your Cloudflare API token
7. Click "Add secret"
