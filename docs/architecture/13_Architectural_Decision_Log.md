## Key Design Decisions

Beyond the formal architectural decisions, several key design decisions shaped the system's implementation.

### Design Decision 1: Scanner Factory Pattern

The system uses a factory pattern for creating scanner instances:

```typescript
export class ScannerFactory {
  static createScannerByType(
    io: IoE, 
    apiKey: string, 
    type: 'check' | 'receipt'
  ): Scanner {
    const container = this.createDIContainer(io, apiKey);
    
    if (type === 'check') {
      return container.getCheckScanner();
    } else {
      return container.getReceiptScanner();
    }
  }
  
  static createMistralCheckScanner(io: IoE, apiKey: string): Scanner {
    const container = this.createDIContainer(io, apiKey);
    return container.getCheckScanner();
  }
  
  static createMistralReceiptScanner(io: IoE, apiKey: string): Scanner {
    const container = this.createDIContainer(io, apiKey);
    return container.getReceiptScanner();
  }
  
  static createDIContainer(io: IoE, apiKey: string): DIContainer {
    return new DIContainer().registerDependencies(io, apiKey, 'ScannerFactory');
  }
}
```

**Rationale**:
- Centralizes scanner creation logic
- Handles dependency resolution through DI container
- Enables creation of appropriate scanner based on document type
- Simplifies client code by hiding complex construction logic
- Facilitates testing through consistent instance creation

### Design Decision 2: Dedicated Endpoints vs. Universal Endpoint

The system provides both dedicated document-specific endpoints and a universal endpoint:

```typescript
// Dedicated check endpoint
app.post('/check', async (c) => { /* Check-specific processing */ });

// Dedicated receipt endpoint
app.post('/receipt', async (c) => { /* Receipt-specific processing */ });

// Universal processing endpoint
app.post('/process', async (c) => {
  const contentTypeParam = c.req.query('type') || 'receipt';
  // Create appropriate scanner based on document type
  const scanner = ScannerFactory.createScannerByType(
    workerIoE, 
    c.env.MISTRAL_API_KEY, 
    contentTypeParam as 'check' | 'receipt'
  );
  // Process using selected scanner
});
```

**Rationale**:
- Dedicated endpoints provide clear, purpose-specific interfaces
- Universal endpoint offers flexibility for multi-document systems
- Type parameter controls processing pipeline
- Consistent response format across endpoints
- Future extensibility for new document types

### Design Decision 3: Result Tuple Type Pattern

The system uses a tuple-based Result type for error handling:

```typescript
// Result type definition
type Result<T, E> = ['ok', T] | ['error', E];

// Usage example
async function processDocument(document: Document): Promise<Result<ScanResult, string>> {
  try {
    // Processing logic
    return ['ok', result];
  } catch (error) {
    return ['error', 'Failed to process document: ' + error.message];
  }
}

// Error handling example
const result = await processDocument(document);
if (result[0] === 'error') {
  // Handle error case
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: result[1] }), {
    status: 500,
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
  });
}
// Handle success case
```

**Rationale**:
- Makes error handling explicit in the type system
- Forces consideration of both success and failure paths
- Simple implementation without additional libraries
- Works well with TypeScript type checking
- Consistent pattern throughout the codebase

### Design Decision 4: Environment-Specific Configuration

The system uses environment-specific configuration in `wrangler.toml`:

```toml
# Development environment
[env.dev]
name = "ocr-checks-worker-dev"
workers_dev = true
vars = { ENVIRONMENT = "development", MISTRAL_DEBUG = true }

# Staging environment
[env.staging]
name = "ocr-checks-worker-staging"
workers_dev = true
vars = { ENVIRONMENT = "staging", MISTRAL_DEBUG = true }

# Production environment
[env.production]
name = "ocr-checks-worker"
workers_dev = true
vars = { ENVIRONMENT = "production", MISTRAL_DEBUG = false }
```

**Rationale**:
- Separates configuration by environment
- Enables environment-specific settings
- Controls debug and logging behavior
- Supports different domain configurations
- Enables different resource limits per environment

### Design Decision 5: Swift Submodule Approach

The Swift client library is managed as a Git submodule:

**Rationale**:
- Separates Swift-specific code from server codebase
- Creates a clean, standalone Swift package
- Enables independent versioning and releases
- Simplifies iOS/macOS integration
- Maintains version relationship with server
- Allows specialized Swift development workflow

## Trade-offs and Considerations

The architecture involves several trade-offs that were carefully considered:

### Trade-off 1: Serverless vs. Traditional Hosting

**Context**:
Serverless deployment offers scalability and reduced operational overhead but comes with constraints on execution time and resources.

**Trade-off**:
- **Benefits**: No server management, automatic scaling, global distribution, cost efficiency for variable traffic
- **Drawbacks**: Limited execution time (30s), CPU constraints (50ms), cold start latency, vendor lock-in concerns

**Decision**:
The serverless approach was selected because the benefits of operational simplicity and automatic scaling outweighed the constraints, which could be mitigated through optimized implementation.

### Trade-off 2: External OCR Service vs. Self-Hosted

**Context**:
Using an external OCR service introduces a dependency but provides superior capabilities compared to self-hosted alternatives.

**Trade-off**:
- **Benefits**: Advanced AI capabilities, reduced implementation complexity, regular updates and improvements
- **Drawbacks**: External dependency, potential availability issues, rate limiting, network latency

**Decision**:
The external OCR service was selected because the advanced capabilities and reduced implementation burden outweighed the dependency concerns, which could be mitigated through retry strategies and fallback mechanisms.

### Trade-off 3: Stateless vs. Persistent Storage

**Context**:
A stateless design simplifies deployment and scaling but requires clients to manage document storage.

**Trade-off**:
- **Benefits**: Enhanced security, simplified compliance, perfect horizontal scaling, reduced attack surface
- **Drawbacks**: No server-side document history, potential duplicate processing, client responsibility for storage

**Decision**:
The stateless approach was selected because the security and scaling benefits outweighed the limitations, and the target use cases did not require server-side document persistence.

### Trade-off 4: TypeScript vs. Plain JavaScript

**Context**:
TypeScript adds type safety but requires an additional build step and learning curve.

**Trade-off**:
- **Benefits**: Strong type safety, improved developer experience, better code quality, enhanced refactoring
- **Drawbacks**: Build complexity, learning curve, type definition maintenance

**Decision**:
TypeScript was selected because the benefits to code quality and maintainability outweighed the additional complexity, especially for a system handling complex document processing.
