# OCR Receipts Server Design Document

## 1. Overview

The OCR Receipts Server is a Cloudflare Worker application designed to process images of receipts, extract structured data, and return formatted information in a consistent JSON format. The system leverages Mistral AI's multimodal capabilities for both Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and structured data extraction.

### 1.1 Business Objectives

- Provide a scalable, reliable service for receipt data extraction
- Support various receipt formats (retail, restaurant, utility bills, etc.)
- Deliver high-quality structured data with confidence scores
- Enable easy integration with financial management and expense tracking systems
- Provide a consistent API interface compatible with the existing OCR Checks Server

### 1.2 Core Features

- **Receipt Image Processing**: Accept and process images of receipts in various formats
- **OCR Technology**: Use Mistral AI to extract text from receipt images
- **Structured Data Extraction**: Convert OCR text to structured JSON data
- **Data Validation**: Validate extracted data against receipt schema
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provide reliability metrics for extracted data
- **Multi-Format Support**: Process different receipt formats (retail, restaurant, utility, etc.)
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and reporting

## 2. System Architecture

The OCR Receipts Server follows a modular, component-based architecture that enables flexibility, maintainability, and extensibility. The architecture is designed to adhere to SOLID principles.

    Worker -->|HTTP Response| Client
```

### 2.2 Component Design

#### 2.2.1 API Layer (Cloudflare Worker)

The Cloudflare Worker serves as the entry point for the system:

- Handles HTTP requests and routes them to appropriate handlers
- Manages CORS and request validation
- Parses input parameters and document content
- Routes requests to document scanners
- Formats and returns API responses
- Implements error handling and logging

Endpoints:
- `POST /receipt` - Primary endpoint for receipt processing
- `POST /process?type=receipt` - Universal processing endpoint with document type parameter

#### 2.2.2 Scanner Layer

The Receipt Scanner orchestrates the processing workflow:

- Accepts receipt document inputs
- Manages OCR processing
- Coordinates structured data extraction
- Calculates confidence scores
- Processes documents in batches

The scanner implements the `DocumentScanner` interface to ensure compatibility with the existing system.

#### 2.2.3 OCR Layer

The OCR Provider handles image-to-text conversion:

- Interfaces with Mistral AI's vision API
- Processes image data
- Returns OCR results with confidence scores
- Supports various image formats
- Handles multi-page documents

#### 2.2.4 Extraction Layer

The Receipt Extractor handles structured data extraction:

- Processes OCR text
- Applies receipt schema
- Extracts structured data
- Validates against schema requirements
- Normalizes data for consistency
- Identifies receipt type and applies specialized extraction rules

#### 2.2.5 Schema Layer

The Receipt Schema defines data structure and validation rules:

- Defines required and optional fields
- Specifies data types and formats
- Enforces validation constraints
- Supports various receipt formats
- Provides TypeScript type definitions

### 2.3 Dependency Injection

The system uses InversifyJS for dependency injection:

- Decouples component creation from usage
- Supports component substitution for testing
- Enables flexible configuration
- Manages component lifecycles

### 2.4 Factory Pattern

A ScannerFactory provides convenient creation methods:

- Creates fully configured scanner instances
- Abstracts dependency configuration
- Supports multiple scanner types
- Enables document type-based scanner selection

## 3. Processing Flow

### 3.1 Receipt Processing Sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API as API Endpoint
    participant Scanner as ReceiptScanner
    participant OCR as OCRProvider
    participant Extractor as ReceiptExtractor
    
    Client->>+API: POST /receipt (image)
    API->>+Scanner: processDocument(document)
    Scanner->>+OCR: processDocuments([document])
    OCR-->>-Scanner: OCR Result
    Scanner->>+Extractor: extractFromText(ocrText)
    Extractor-->>-Scanner: JSON Data
    Scanner-->>-API: Processing Result
    API-->>-Client: JSON Response
```

### 3.2 Processing Steps

1. **Document Reception**
   - System receives HTTP POST with receipt image
   - Validates content type and document format
   - Creates document object with metadata

2. **OCR Processing**
   - Image is sent to Mistral AI vision API
   - AI extracts text content from image
   - OCR results are returned with confidence score

3. **Data Extraction**
   - OCR text is processed for structured extraction
   - Receipt type is identified
   - Receipt schema is applied
   - Data is validated against schema requirements
   - Structured data is returned with confidence score

4. **Result Compilation**
   - OCR and extraction results are combined
   - Overall confidence score is calculated
   - Final response is formatted
   - Result is returned to client

## 4. Data Model

### 4.1 Input Document

```typescript
interface Document {
  content: ArrayBuffer;
  type: DocumentType; // Image or PDF
  name?: string;
}
```

### 4.2 Receipt Schema

The Receipt schema includes:

- Merchant information (name, address, phone, etc.)
- Receipt details (number, type, timestamp)
- Financial information (totals, tax, tip, etc.)
- Line items (products, services, etc.)
- Payment methods
- Additional metadata

See [Receipt Schema Documentation](receipt-schema.md) for full details.

### 4.3 Processing Result

```typescript
interface ProcessingResult {
  json: Receipt;
  ocrConfidence: number;
  extractionConfidence: number;
  overallConfidence: number;
  rawText?: string;
}
```

### 4.4 API Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "merchant": {
      "name": "ACME Store",
      "address": "123 Main St"
    },
    "timestamp": "2023-01-01T12:34:56Z",
    "totals": {
      "subtotal": 42.99,
      "tax": 3.44,
      "total": 46.43
    },
    "currency": "USD",
    "items": [
      {
        "description": "Product 1",
        "quantity": 2,
        "unitPrice": 12.99,
        "totalPrice": 25.98
      }
    ]
  },
  "confidence": {
    "ocr": 0.95,
    "extraction": 0.89,
    "overall": 0.92
  }
}
```

## 5. Error Handling

All errors return a consistent JSON format:

```json
{
  "error": "Error message describing the issue",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE",
  "details": { 
    "additional": "information" 
  }
}
```

HTTP status codes:
- 400 Bad Request: Client errors (invalid input)
