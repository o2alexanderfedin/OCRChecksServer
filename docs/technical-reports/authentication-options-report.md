## Token-Based Authentication Approaches

| Approach | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| **JWT** | Self-contained, stateless, standard-based | Token size, revocation challenges | Applications needing rich user context in authentication |
| **API Keys** | Simple, long-lived, easy to implement | Less secure, no user context, management overhead | Simple API access, machine-to-machine communication |
| **OAuth Access Tokens** | Short-lived, revocable, standard workflow | Implementation complexity, requires refresh mechanism | Applications integrating with multiple services/APIs |

#### Recommendation
For mobile and web applications, **JWT tokens with short expiration** provide the best balance of security and usability when combined with a refresh token mechanism.

## Security Considerations

| Aspect | Best Practice | OWASP Recommendation |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Token Storage** | Secure storage (Keychain/KeyStore) | Never store sensitive auth data in local storage or cookies |
| **Communication** | HTTPS/TLS for all API calls | Implement certificate pinning for high-security applications |
| **Session Management** | Short token lifetimes with refresh tokens | Implement proper session timeout and server-side revocation |
| **Authentication Factors** | Implement 2FA where possible | Combine multiple authentication factors for sensitive operations |
| **Biometrics** | Use as second factor, not primary | Always provide fallback authentication method |

## Minimal Server-Side Architecture

For an architecture that minimizes server-side user management while supporting auth and payments:

1. **Authentication**: Use Firebase Authentication with Apple/Google Sign In
2. **API Authorization**: Generate JWTs after successful authentication for API access
3. **Payments**: Use Stripe Elements/Checkout with serverless functions
4. **Subscriptions**: Use platform-native verification or third-party service like RevenueCat

This approach delegates most user management to established providers while keeping a thin server layer for critical operations.

## Stateless App Subscription Verification Architecture

For a completely stateless architecture where a Cloudflare Worker verifies app subscriptions without storing data:

### Architecture Overview

![Stateless App Subscription Verification Architecture](https://mermaid.ink/img/pako:eNqNkUFrwzAMhf-K0SmDJt0oCTss4ENhMNZT2XaQZToRjZ3JcgYl-e9z0jVZYexgiWeff0-SUQJGZpCQWnRmQO-s3AoUvTGjdQXdA7x0JuKiVj6H0SjJGsLZGi8P_LqKzE51KLFG5rHvFYmQZNQRdlajGkvDMavBY8QJPLrgjKPPY3v0fUkUWBMK_hH8I38WdOKPNQZ5FDl3UaMveUlLPw-wB-p_Yh73kGpjEt6bZvJK17FY-l-ww9YZRvwIScMNl4Rt-8EYUuWSjCTKlKJjDHpHOUgMiiwotpAU6ORYLpeEQ9WqGvYkjXShXPJ8ZC6UpW15eZ2nJ5U3WZ6L9Ox4VtQLSHO9WstFnRZVUZ1-fwAl4Yk0)

### Key Components

1. **Mobile Applications**
   - iOS App using StoreKit 2 for subscription management
   - Android App using Google Play Billing Library
   - Apps include client libraries to generate verifiable authentication tokens

2. **Cloudflare Worker (Stateless Service)**
   - Handles OCR processing requests
   - Verifies subscription status without storing any subscription data
   - Uses platform-specific verification APIs to validate subscriptions in real-time

3. **Platform-Specific Verification Services**
   - Apple App Store Server API for iOS subscription verification
   - Google Play Developer API for Android subscription verification

### Authentication and Verification Flow

1. **App-Side Token Generation**
   - App obtains receipt/purchase token from platform (Apple/Google)
   - App generates a signed request with:
     - Purchase receipt/token
     - Timestamp
     - Device identifier (for request correlation)
     - Request payload (receipt image)

2. **Cloudflare Worker Verification**
   - Worker receives the request with subscription evidence
   - Worker verifies the token signature (using public key cryptography)
   - For iOS: Calls Apple's App Store Server API to verify subscription status
   - For Android: Calls Google Play Developer API to verify subscription status
   - Both verification requests include the original purchase token/receipt

3. **Request Processing**
   - If verification succeeds, the worker processes the OCR request
   - If verification fails, the request is rejected with appropriate error code
   - No subscription data is stored on the worker

### Implementation Considerations

1. **API Credentials Management**
   - Store Apple/Google API credentials as environment variables in Cloudflare Worker
   - Use Cloudflare Worker Secrets for secure storage

2. **Cryptographic Verification**
   - Implement JWT or similar token-based authentication
   - Use public/private key pairs for request signing and verification

3. **Request Quotas and Rate Limiting**
   - Implement rate limiting on the Cloudflare Worker
   - Consider platform-specific quotas for verification API calls

4. **Caching Strategies**
   - Implement minimal short-lived caching of verification results (30-60 seconds)
   - Use request hashing to maintain stateless design while improving performance

5. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful handling of verification service outages
   - Clear error messages for expired subscriptions vs. verification failures

This architecture provides a fully stateless solution that securely verifies app subscriptions without storing any user or subscription data on the server side, meeting the requirement for minimal server-side management while ensuring only legitimate paid users can access the OCR service.

## Implementation Recommendations

### For Web Applications

1. Implement Firebase Authentication with multiple providers (Google, Apple, email)
2. Use Firebase custom tokens or ID tokens for API authorization
3. Implement Stripe Checkout with serverless functions for payment processing
4. Store minimal user data in Firebase Firestore or similar NoSQL database

### For iOS Applications

1. Implement Sign in with Apple (required if other social login is offered)
2. Add Google Sign In as an alternative option
3. Implement StoreKit 2 for in-app purchases and subscriptions
4. Use Apple's server-to-server notification service for subscription events
5. Store authentication state securely in Keychain

### For Android Applications

1. Implement Google Sign In as primary auth method
2. Add other social providers through Firebase Authentication
3. Implement Google Play Billing Library for in-app purchases
4. Implement server-side purchase verification for security
5. Use Android Keystore for secure credential storage

## Conclusion

The optimal authentication solution for minimizing server-side management while supporting payment systems and subscriptions is a hybrid approach leveraging:

1. **Federated identity providers** (Firebase Auth with Google/Apple Sign In)
2. **Serverless functions** for secure operations requiring server-side logic
3. **Platform-native APIs** for in-app purchases and subscriptions
4. **JWT tokens** for secure API access

This approach balances security, user experience, development efficiency, and operational simplicity while avoiding the complexities of building and maintaining a complete user management system.
