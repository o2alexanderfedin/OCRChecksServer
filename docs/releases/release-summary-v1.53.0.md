# Release Summary: v1.53.0 - Fortify [Maintenance]

## Overview

This release focuses on improving the codebase stability, cross-platform compatibility, and proper API authentication patterns. It addresses key issues with Buffer handling in Cloudflare Workers and fixes improper access to private fields in the Mistral API client.

## Key Improvements

### Cross-platform Buffer Implementation

- Simplified Buffer polyfill for Cloudflare Workers environment
- Added direct `stringToBase64` and `arrayBufferToBase64` utility functions
- Made code more maintainable by using standard Buffer patterns
- Verified compatibility across Node.js and Cloudflare Workers environments

### Proper API Authentication Handling

- Removed attempts to access private API key fields from MistralOCRProvider
- Used proper constructor-based initialization for Mistral client
- Fixed improper property access that could cause authentication failures

### Swift Test Improvements 

- Fixed Swift end-to-end tests to properly load environment variables
- Added explicit loading of `.dev.vars` file to ensure API key availability
- Improved logging of environment variables in Swift tests

## Impact

This release improves the stability and security of the OCR processing system by:

1. Ensuring cross-platform compatibility for binary data handling
2. Following proper API authentication patterns
3. Improving test reliability

## Technical Details

- The Buffer implementation now properly handles polyfills without trying to reimplement the entire Buffer API
- Authentication follows the pattern recommended by the Mistral SDK without accessing private fields
- The tests have been updated to reflect these changes and ensure continued compatibility

## Affected Components

- `src/ocr/base64.ts` - Buffer implementation and base64 conversion
- `src/ocr/mistral.ts` - MistralOCRProvider initialization
- `scripts/run-swift-e2e-tests.sh` - Swift test environment setup
