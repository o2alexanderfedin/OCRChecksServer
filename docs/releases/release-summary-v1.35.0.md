## Files Modified

1. **Core Logic**:
   - `src/json/mistral.ts`: Updated property names, error handling, and confidence calculation
   - `src/di/test-container.ts`: Updated mock implementation for TypeScript compatibility

2. **Tests**:
   - `tests/unit/json/mistral.test.ts`: Updated test expectations and mock implementations

## Deployment
- Successfully deployed to Cloudflare Workers at https://ocr-checks-worker.af-4a0.workers.dev
- Used `deploy:with-secrets.sh` script to properly secure Mistral API key
- Verified health endpoint is returning correct version: 1.35.0
- Deployed on May 04, 2025

## Next Steps
- Consider monitoring and fallback mechanisms for service unavailability situations
- Implement a status endpoint for checking Mistral service availability
- Explore alternative OCR providers for potential fallback options
- Update smoke tests to work with the Cloudflare Workers endpoint

## Conclusion
Release v1.35.0 significantly improves the system's ability to handle and diagnose Mistral API issues, making it more robust and maintainable in production environments.
