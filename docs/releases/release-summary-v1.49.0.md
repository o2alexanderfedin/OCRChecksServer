# Release Summary: v1.49.0

## Overview

This release enhances the project's Git submodule management capabilities and introduces comprehensive process improvements for technical debt tracking and development guidelines.

## Key Features

### Git Submodule Management

- **Submodule Helper Script**: Added an interactive script (`scripts/submodule-helper.sh`) for common submodule operations including update, commit, push, and status checks
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Created comprehensive guides for Git submodules and Swift submodule management
- **NolockCapture Integration**: Added structure for the NolockCapture library as a new submodule with depth-aware document capture

### Process Improvements

- **Technical Debt Tracking**: Created a robust system for tracking and managing technical debt with clear rules and templates
- **Development Guidelines**: Established explicit requirements for following GitFlow, TDD, SOLID, and KISS principles
- **Continuous Improvement**: Implemented a structured approach for continuously improving tools and documentation

## Detailed Changes

### Added

- `scripts/submodule-helper.sh` interactive script for submodule management
- `docs/git-submodule-guide.md` with comprehensive submodule usage documentation
- `docs/swift-submodule-guide.md` for Swift-specific submodule guidance
- `docs/nolock-capture-guide.md` explaining the NolockCapture library
- `.claude/rules/submodule-management.md` with best practices for Git submodules
- `.claude/rules/continuous-improvement.md` for enhancing tools and documentation
- `.claude/rules/technical-debt-tracking.md` establishing a debt tracking system
- `.claude/TECHNICAL_DEBT.md` for tracking pending improvements
- `.claude/post-mortems/feature-add-submodule-utilities.md` with lessons learned

### Changed

- Improved `swift-proxy` submodule with HEIC to PNG conversion
- Enhanced post-mortem template with development process requirements
- Updated development guidelines in CLAUDE.md with explicit references to new rules
- Improved submodule reference management in the main repository

## Process Changes

This release introduces significant process improvements:

1. **GitFlow Enforcement**: All development must occur in GitFlow feature branches
2. **Architectural Design First**: New features require design documents before implementation
3. **Test-Driven Development**: All development should follow TDD principles
4. **Principles-Based Development**: SOLID and KISS principles must be applied
5. **Technical Debt Management**: System for tracking, prioritizing, and addressing debt
6. **Continuous Improvement**: Process for enhancing tools and documentation based on experience

## Breaking Changes

None.

## Deprecations

None.

## Future Plans

- Enhance Swift proxy tests with comprehensive coverage
- Implement NolockCapture tests for core components
- Automate submodule updates during GitFlow release process
- Develop more robust process for design documentation
