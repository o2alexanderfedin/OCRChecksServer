bash scripts/deploy-with-secrets.sh

# Deploy to staging
bash scripts/deploy-with-secrets.sh staging
```

For monitoring and troubleshooting:

```bash
# View all logs
bash scripts/tail-logs.sh

# Filter for errors in staging
bash scripts/tail-logs.sh --env staging --errors

# Monitor Mistral API errors
bash scripts/tail-logs.sh --search "MISTRAL API ERROR"
```

## Security Improvements

- Removed all API keys from wrangler.toml
- Enhanced documentation about secure API key management
- Improved API key validation with better error messages
- Added guidance on proper secrets management for different environments
