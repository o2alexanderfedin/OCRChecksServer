# OCR Checks Server TDD Implementation Plan

## Analysis of Current State

Based on the codebase review, we have a solid foundation with many core components already implemented:

1. OCR processing using Mistral AI (`MistralOCRProvider`)
2. JSON extraction using Mistral AI (`MistralJsonExtractorProvider`)
3. Receipt extraction from OCR text (`ReceiptExtractor`)
4. Document scanning that combines OCR and extraction (`ReceiptScanner`)
5. Dependency injection container (`DIContainer`)

The unit tests, functional tests, and integration tests for these components are also already in place.

## Implementation Gaps

Based on the tech architecture design document and code review, I've identified the following gaps:

1. **Check Processing Focus**: The current system is mainly focused on receipts, but we need to enhance it to process checks as specified in the README.
2. **Check Schema Definition**: We need to define a schema for check data.
3. **Check Extractor**: We need to implement a specialized extractor for checks.
4. **Error Handling Enhancements**: Improve error handling and provide more detailed error messages.
5. **Confidence Score Improvements**: Enhance confidence score calculation for better reliability metrics.
6. **Multiple Document Type Support**: Add support for different document types beyond receipts and checks.
7. **Unit and Integration Tests**: Add tests for the new components and enhancements.

## Test-Driven Development Approach

Following the TDD methodology, we will:

1. Write failing tests first
2. Implement the minimal code to make the tests pass
3. Refactor for better design while maintaining test coverage
4. Repeat the process for each feature

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Check Schema

- **Tests**: Create tests for check schema validation.
- **Implementation**: Define a JSON schema for check data with required fields.

### 2. Check Extractor

- **Tests**: Create unit tests for check extraction functionality.
- **Implementation**: Implement `CheckExtractor` class similar to `ReceiptExtractor`.

### 3. Check Scanner

- **Tests**: Create unit tests for a check scanner that uses the check extractor.
- **Implementation**: Implement `CheckScanner` or enhance `ReceiptScanner` to handle checks.

### 4. Enhanced Confidence Scoring

- **Tests**: Create tests for improved confidence scoring mechanisms.
- **Implementation**: Enhance the confidence score calculation based on multiple factors.

### 5. Factory Enhancements

- **Tests**: Create tests for enhanced factory methods.
- **Implementation**: Add factory methods for creating check scanners.

### 6. Endpoint Implementation

- **Tests**: Create integration tests for the API endpoints.
- **Implementation**: Implement or enhance API endpoints for check processing.

### 7. Error Handling

- **Tests**: Create tests for error scenarios.
- **Implementation**: Enhance error handling throughout the pipeline.

## Test Categories

For each component, we'll develop tests in these categories:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation.
2. **Functional Tests**: Test the functional programming style components.
3. **Semi-Integration Tests**: Test with real external dependencies.
4. **Integration Tests**: Test the complete flow.

## TDD Implementation Sequence

1. Start with `CheckSchema` definition and tests
2. Move to `CheckExtractor` implementation and tests
3. Implement `CheckScanner` or enhance `ReceiptScanner`
4. Enhance the factory with check processing capabilities
5. Enhance API endpoints
6. Add integration tests for the complete flow

By following this test-driven approach, we'll ensure that the implementation is robust, well-tested, and adheres to SOLID principles.
