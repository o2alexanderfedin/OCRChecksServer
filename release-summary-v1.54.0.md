# Release v1.54.0 Summary

## Overview
This release adds comprehensive server performance testing infrastructure to help optimize and monitor server startup performance. It also fixes several test-related issues and improves the test organization.

## Key Features
- Added dedicated performance test category with statistical analysis
- Implemented server startup performance metrics (min, max, avg, percentiles)
- Set performance targets (1.5s target, 2.5s maximum, 3s hard limit)
- Fixed server readiness detection across tests
- Improved test filtering and organization

## Changes
- Added new performance test directory and test files
- Created detailed statistical performance analysis tools
- Added support for running performance tests separately
- Fixed server process cleanup and error handling
- Improved test filtering in run-tests.js

## Technical Details
- Server startup performance is now measured with consistent detection
- Statistical metrics include P50, P90, P95, and P99 percentiles
- Performance tests run with extended timeouts (5 minutes)
- Implemented proper process cleanup to prevent orphaned processes
- Added color-coded visual output for performance metrics

## Documentation
- Added README.md in the performance test directory
- Documented performance targets and optimization recommendations

## Fixes
- Fixed server readiness detection pattern consistency
- Added null-safety checks for process PIDs
- Fixed test filtering in run-tests.js
- Fixed timestamp type handling in health.test.ts
