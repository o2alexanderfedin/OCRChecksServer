# Release v1.54.0 Summary

## Overview
This release adds comprehensive server performance testing infrastructure to help optimize and monitor server startup performance. It also implements robust rate limiting for Mistral API calls, adds curl-based integration tests for direct API endpoint testing, fixes several test-related issues, and improves the test organization.

## Key Features
- Added dedicated performance test category with statistical analysis
- Implemented server startup performance metrics (min, max, avg, percentiles)
- Set performance targets (1.5s target, 2.5s maximum, 3s hard limit)
- Implemented queue-based rate limiting for Mistral API calls (6 requests/second limit)
- Added curl-based integration tests for direct HTTP testing of API endpoints
- Fixed server readiness detection across tests
- Improved test filtering and organization

## Changes
- Added new performance test directory and test files
- Created queue-based rate limiting system for API calls
- Created detailed statistical performance analysis tools
- Added curl-based integration test scripts with server lifecycle management
- Added support for running performance tests separately
- Fixed server process cleanup and error handling
- Improved test filtering in run-tests.js

## Technical Details
- Server startup performance is now measured with consistent detection
- Statistical metrics include P50, P90, P95, and P99 percentiles
- Performance tests run with extended timeouts (5 minutes)
- Implemented proper process cleanup to prevent orphaned processes
- Added color-coded visual output for performance metrics
- Added throttledFetch utility that respects API rate limits
- Added configurable delays between test files to prevent rate limit errors
- Added timeout protection for rate-limited tasks
- Added dynamic port allocation for curl-based tests to avoid conflicts
- Added configurable timeout handling for AI-powered endpoints in curl tests

## Documentation
- Added README.md in the performance test directory
- Added rate-limiting-implementation.md with detailed implementation information
- Documented performance targets and optimization recommendations
- Added curl-testing-guide.md with usage instructions for HTTP-based testing

## Fixes
- Fixed server readiness detection pattern consistency
- Fixed Mistral API rate limit handling in integration tests
- Added proper server process cleanup to prevent orphaned processes
- Added null-safety checks for process PIDs
- Fixed test filtering in run-tests.js
- Fixed timestamp type handling in health.test.ts
- Fixed timeout issues for AI processing endpoints

## NPM Commands
Added the following npm commands:
- `npm run test:integration:curl`: Run curl tests against a running server
- `npm run test:integration:curl:verbose`: Run tests with detailed output
- `npm run test:integration:curl:full`: Run tests with server lifecycle management
