# Release Summary for v1.48.0

## Overview

This release focuses on enhancing the Mistral API testing capabilities and improving image quality in the Swift proxy client through PNG format adoption.

## Key Features

### Mistral API Testing Enhancements

- **Organized Test Structure**: Created a dedicated directory structure for Mistral API test scripts in `scripts/mistral-tests/`
- **Direct API Testing**: Added `test-mistral-now.js` for testing the Mistral API directly with image inputs
- **OCR Testing**: Added `test-mistral-ocr.js` for testing receipt OCR and structured data extraction
- **Text Extraction Testing**: Added `test-mistral-text.js` for testing document text extraction
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added a README.md with usage instructions for all Mistral test scripts

### Image Quality Improvements in Swift Client

- **PNG Format Adoption**: Changed HEIC image conversion in Swift proxy to use PNG format instead of JPEG
- **Lossless Image Quality**: Improved image quality through lossless PNG format for better OCR results
- **Header Updates**: Updated Content-Type headers to properly use `image/png`
- **Compression Removal**: Removed unnecessary compression quality parameters for the lossless PNG format
- **Documentation Updates**: Enhanced Swift proxy documentation with PNG format details and updated CHANGELOG.md

## Testing Recommendations

To ensure proper functionality with these changes:

1. Test OCR processing with PNG images to verify server compatibility
2. Run the new Mistral API test scripts to validate API connectivity
3. Verify that HEIC images are correctly converted to PNG in the Swift client on both iOS and macOS platforms

## Deployment Notes

- This release requires no special deployment steps
- Standard deployment procedures apply: `npm run deploy:with-secrets`
- No database migrations or dependency changes required

## Future Improvements

- Consider adding support for WebP format as an alternative to PNG for smaller file sizes
- Add automated tests that validate image quality preservation in format conversions
- Explore additional opportunities for direct API testing with other formats
