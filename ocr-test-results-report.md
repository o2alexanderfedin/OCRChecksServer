## OCR Processing Flow

The OCR processing follows these steps:

1. **Document Input**: The system accepts various document formats (JPG, PNG, HEIC, PDF)
2. **Pre-processing**: Documents are converted to appropriate format for the Mistral API
3. **OCR Processing**: The Mistral OCR API extracts text from the document
4. **Text Extraction**: Raw OCR text is processed into a structured format
5. **JSON Extraction**: Structured data is extracted from the OCR text
6. **Validation**: The extracted data is validated against the expected schema
7. **Confidence Scoring**: The system calculates confidence scores for the extraction

## Confidence Scoring

The system calculates three confidence scores for each processed document:

1. **OCR Confidence**: Measures the confidence in the text extraction (0.0-1.0)
2. **Extraction Confidence**: Measures the confidence in the JSON extraction from text (0.0-1.0)
3. **Overall Confidence**: Combined score that weighs both OCR and extraction (0.0-1.0)

## Error Handling

The testing also verified proper error handling for:

1. Invalid API keys
2. Rate limit handling
3. Malformed documents
4. Unsupported file formats
5. Failed OCR extraction

## Conclusion

The OCR system successfully processes documents and extracts structured data with high accuracy. The integration with Mistral AI provides reliable text extraction, and the implemented JSON extraction process converts the text into well-structured data. The system handles errors appropriately and provides useful confidence scores to evaluate the reliability of the extracted data.

The updated Buffer compatibility layer ensures the system works across different environments, including Cloudflare Workers and Node.js, making it versatile for various deployment scenarios.
