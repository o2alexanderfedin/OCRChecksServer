# Git Submodule Resolution Attempt Report

## Initial Analysis

1. **Identified relevant documentation**:
   - Found and read `/Users/alexanderfedin/Projects/OCRChecksServer/prompts/git-submodule-workflow.md`
   - Found and read `/Users/alexanderfedin/Projects/OCRChecksServer/docs/git-submodule-guide.md`

2. **Current branch status**:
   - Confirmed we're on branch `release/v1.49.0`
   - Found untracked `prompts/` directory containing git-submodule-workflow.md

3. **Submodule status check**:
   ```
   548ffc28cac1e5d2508441a6d7882e9102cbe2c7 nolock-capture-lib (heads/main)
   73c57f0e99f9082385393861be78dc7c9a691878 swift-proxy (heads/develop)
   ```

4. **Submodule detailed status**:
   - Both submodules in detached HEAD state
   - Both submodules had clean working trees
   ```
   HEAD detached at 73c57f0
   nothing to commit, working tree clean
   HEAD detached at 548ffc2
   nothing to commit, working tree clean
   ```

## Steps Taken

1. **Fixed detached HEAD state in submodules**:
   - Put swift-proxy on develop branch: `cd swift-proxy && git checkout develop && cd -`
     - Successfully switched to develop branch
   - Put nolock-capture-lib on main branch: `cd nolock-capture-lib && git checkout main && cd -`
     - Successfully switched to main branch

2. **Added untracked content to main repo**:
   - Added untracked `prompts/` directory: `git add prompts/`
   - Committed the addition: `git commit -m "docs: add git-submodule-workflow.md prompt"`
     - Commit succeeded: `[release/v1.49.0 3ef0798] docs: add git-submodule-workflow.md prompt`

3. **Attempted to finish release**:
   - Executed: `git flow release finish v1.49.0`
   - Result: Failed with error about untracked files in swift-proxy

## Error Details

When attempting to finish the release, we received the following error:

```
error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by checkout:
	swift-proxy/.gitignore
	swift-proxy/.spi.yml
	swift-proxy/CHANGELOG.md
	swift-proxy/CONTRIBUTING.md
	swift-proxy/Examples/AsyncCheckProcessingExample.swift
	swift-proxy/Examples/CheckProcessingExample.swift
	swift-proxy/Examples/Main.swift
	swift-proxy/LICENSE
	swift-proxy/Package.swift
	swift-proxy/README.md
	swift-proxy/Sources/Models/Check.swift
	swift-proxy/Sources/Models/Common.swift
	swift-proxy/Sources/Models/Receipt.swift

	swift-proxy/Tests/README.md
Please move or remove them before you switch branches.
Aborting
Could not check out main.
```

## Diagnosis

The issue appears to be:

1. Git sees all files in the swift-proxy submodule as untracked, even though we've checked out the correct branch within the submodule.

2. When git-flow attempts to switch branches during the release finish process, it's encountering conflicts with these "untracked" files.

3. This is a common issue with Git submodules during branch switching, especially in GitFlow workflows where multiple branch switches happen automatically.

## Next Steps to Consider

Based on the documentation and current state, I would recommend:

1. **Synchronize submodule state properly**:
   ```bash
   # From the parent repo root
   git submodule sync
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. **Consider stashing submodule changes temporarily**:
   ```bash
   # Enter each submodule and stash any changes
   cd swift-proxy
   git stash
   cd ../nolock-capture-lib
   git stash
   cd ..
   ```

3. **Check if submodule references need updating in the parent repo**:
   ```bash
   # Add submodule references to ensure they're properly tracked
   git add swift-proxy nolock-capture-lib
   git commit -m "Update submodule references before finishing release"
   ```

4. **Try the recommended approach for fixing conflicting submodule files**:
   ```bash
   git submodule deinit -f swift-proxy
   git submodule update --init swift-proxy
   ```

5. **Consider manually performing git-flow operations**:
   Instead of using the git-flow command, manually perform the necessary merges and branch switches.

## Observed Pattern

The issue appears to be related to how Git tracks the state of files within submodules during branch switching operations. When GitFlow performs branch switching, it's not properly accounting for the submodule state, causing conflicts with files that should be part of the submodule but are being seen as untracked files in the parent repository.
