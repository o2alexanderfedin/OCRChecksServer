# Feature Post-Mortem: Investigate and Fix Test Error

## Summary
This feature investigated and resolved an "unknown error" occurring during test execution. The implementation includes adding proper type safety to API responses in integration tests and organizing type definitions according to project patterns.

## Issues Encountered
- Tests failed with a cryptic "unknown error" message
- Type checking wasn't catching property access errors on untyped objects
- Importing type definitions between tests and source files faced module resolution challenges
- Timeout issues initially obscured the root cause of the error
- Version expectation in test was outdated compared to actual API response

## Root Causes
- Missing type assertions when parsing API responses led to runtime errors
- TypeScript's compile-time type checking doesn't prevent runtime property access errors
- JSON.parse() returns type 'any' which bypasses TypeScript's type checking
- Response.json() returns Promise<unknown> which requires type assertion
- Module resolution in the test environment differed from the development environment

## Solutions Applied
- Added explicit type assertions using TypeScript's `as` operator:
  ```typescript
  const data = await response.json() as HealthResponse;
  ```
- Created interfaces for response types:
  ```typescript
  interface HealthResponse {
    status: string;
    version: string;
    timestamp: string;
  }
  ```
- Updated version expectation in tests to match current API version
- Reverted temporary timeout increase after diagnosis completed

## Lessons Learned
- Type assertions are critical when working with external data in TypeScript
- Vague "unknown error" messages often indicate type safety issues
- Thoroughly inspect error stack traces even when the error message is unhelpful
- Test against real API responses rather than hardcoded expectations when possible
- Module import strategies differ between test and production environments
- Temporary debugging changes should be clearly marked for reversal

## Rule Updates
- Created new type safety rule: `.claude/rules/type-safety-api-responses.md`
- Documented pattern for properly typing API responses
- Added preventative strategies for catching these issues earlier

## Follow-up Actions
- Consider adding ESLint rules to enforce type assertions on API responses
- Update other tests to follow the same pattern for consistency
- Evaluate tools for automatic API type generation from responses
